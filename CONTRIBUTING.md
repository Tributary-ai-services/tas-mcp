   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make changes**:
   - Write code
   - Add/update tests
   - Update documentation

7. **Create pull request** on GitHub

## Style Guidelines

### Go Code Style

- Follow [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Document exported types and functions

### Example:
```go
// EventProcessor processes incoming MCP events according to configured rules.
// It implements retry logic and metric collection.
type EventProcessor struct {
    logger    *zap.Logger
    forwarder EventForwarder
    metrics   *ProcessorMetrics
}

// ProcessEvent validates and processes a single event.
// It returns an error if the event cannot be processed.
func (p *EventProcessor) ProcessEvent(ctx context.Context, event *Event) error {
    // Validate event
    if err := p.validateEvent(event); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("validation failed: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Process event
    start := time.Now()
    if err := p.forwarder.Forward(ctx, event); err != nil {
        p.metrics.IncrementErrors()
        return fmt.Errorf("forwarding failed: %w", err)
    }
    
    p.metrics.RecordLatency(time.Since(start))
    return nil
}
```

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Keep documentation up-to-date
- Use proper markdown formatting
