## 🏗️ Technical Implementation Plan

### Federation Strategy

Our approach prioritizes **federation over reimplementation** with **cloud-native architecture**:

1. **Existing Server Integration** - Connect to proven MCP servers from the ecosystem
2. **Protocol Bridge** - Translate between TAS MCP and external MCP servers
3. **Service Registry** - Maintain a catalog of federated servers
4. **Health Monitoring** - Track availability of external services
5. **Fallback Services** - Implement our own servers only when needed

### Service Mesh Architecture

TAS MCP leverages **Kubernetes Service Mesh** for production-grade traffic management:

#### **🕸️ Service Mesh Benefits**
- **Circuit Breaking** - Automatic failure detection and traffic isolation
- **Load Balancing** - Intelligent request distribution across service instances
- **Rate Limiting** - Traffic throttling and quota management
- **Retry Logic** - Configurable retry policies with exponential backoff
- **Traffic Splitting** - A/B testing and canary deployments for MCP services
- **mTLS** - Automatic mutual TLS between all services
- **Observability** - Built-in metrics, tracing, and logging

#### **🔧 Service Mesh Options**
- **Istio** (Preferred) - Feature-rich with extensive traffic management
- **Linkerd** (Alternative) - Lightweight with excellent performance
- **Consul Connect** - HashiCorp ecosystem integration

#### **📊 Service Mesh Features**
```yaml
# Example Istio configuration for MCP services
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: mcp-federation
spec:
  http:
  - match:
    - uri:
        prefix: "/api/v1/mcp/"
    retries:
      attempts: 3
      perTryTimeout: 2s
    timeout: 10s
    fault:
      delay:
        percentage:
          value: 0.1
        fixedDelay: 5s
```

### Federation Implementation Template

Each federated MCP service will follow this structure:

```
internal/federation/<service-name>/
├── client.go          # MCP client for external server
├── bridge.go          # Protocol translation layer
├── config.go          # Federation configuration
├── health.go          # Health monitoring
├── fallback.go        # Local fallback implementation (optional)
└── README.md          # Federation documentation
```

### Service Implementation Template

For services we implement ourselves, each will follow this structure:

```
internal/services/<service-name>/
├── client.go          # Service client implementation
├── client_test.go     # Comprehensive tests
├── config.go          # Service-specific configuration
├── types.go           # Request/response types
├── errors.go          # Error handling
└── README.md          # Service documentation
```

### Service Requirements

Each service must implement:

1. **Standard Interface**
   ```go
   type MCPService interface {
       Name() string
       Category() string
       Capabilities() []string
       Invoke(ctx context.Context, operation string, params map[string]interface{}) (interface{}, error)
       Health(ctx context.Context) error
   }
   ```

2. **Authentication Support**
   - API Key
   - OAuth2
   - JWT
   - Custom auth

3. **Error Handling**
   - Retry logic (handled by service mesh)
   - Timeout management (configured via service mesh policies)
   - Graceful degradation

4. **Observability**
   - Metrics collection
   - Distributed tracing
   - Structured logging

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests (>80% coverage)
   - Integration tests
   - Mock implementations
   - Performance benchmarks
