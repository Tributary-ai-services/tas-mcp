# üó∫Ô∏è TAS MCP Server Roadmap

## üìã Overview

This roadmap outlines the development priorities for the TAS MCP Server, with a focus on becoming the **Universal MCP Orchestrator**. With 1,535+ existing MCP servers available, our strategy is to federate with the entire ecosystem rather than rebuild it.

**Vision**: Transform TAS MCP from an event gateway into the central hub that provides unified access to the world's largest collection of AI-accessible tools and services.

## üåê MCP Ecosystem Landscape

Based on [mcpservers.org](https://mcpservers.org), the MCP ecosystem is **massive** with **1,535 existing servers** across 12 major categories:

| Category | Examples | Key Capabilities |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| **üîç Search** | Brave, DuckDuckGo, Exa, arXiv, Tavily | Web search, academic papers, AI-optimized search |
| **üóÑÔ∏è Database** | BigQuery, Chroma, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, Airtable | SQL/NoSQL, vector databases, analytics |
| **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Service** | AWS Core, Aiven, Alibaba Cloud, Azure | Cloud infrastructure, managed services |
| **üíª Development** | GitHub, GitLab, Code analysis, Testing | Version control, CI/CD, code quality |
| **üí¨ Communication** | Slack, Bluesky, Email, DingTalk, Discord | Team chat, social media, messaging |
| **üåê Web Scraping** | Apify, Crawl4AI, Firecrawl, Playwright | Content extraction, browser automation |
| **üìã Productivity** | ClickUp, Asana, Coda, Calendar | Task management, documentation, scheduling |

| **üìÅ File System** | Local files, document processing | File operations, content analysis |
| **üîß Version Control** | Git operations, repository management | Source code versioning |
| **‚úÖ Official** | Anthropic and partner-maintained servers | Enterprise-grade, officially supported |
| **üîó Other** | Specialized tools, AI models, utilities | Niche applications and integrations |

**Federation Strategy**: With 1,535+ servers available, our approach is to become the **universal MCP orchestrator** - federating with the ecosystem rather than rebuilding it. This positions TAS MCP as the central hub for all MCP services.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Plan

### Federation Strategy

Our approach prioritizes **federation over reimplementation**:

1. **Existing Server Integration** - Connect to proven MCP servers from the ecosystem
2. **Protocol Bridge** - Translate between TAS MCP and external MCP servers
3. **Service Registry** - Maintain a catalog of federated servers
4. **Health Monitoring** - Track availability of external services
5. **Fallback Services** - Implement our own servers only when needed

### Federation Implementation Template

Each federated MCP service will follow this structure:

```
internal/federation/<service-name>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client.go          # MCP client for external server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bridge.go          # Protocol translation layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.go          # Federation configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ health.go          # Health monitoring
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fallback.go        # Local fallback implementation (optional)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Federation documentation
```

### Service Implementation Template

For services we implement ourselves, each will follow this structure:

```
internal/services/<service-name>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client.go          # Service client implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client_test.go     # Comprehensive tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.go          # Service-specific configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.go           # Request/response types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ errors.go          # Error handling
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Service documentation
```

### Service Requirements

Each service must implement:

1. **Standard Interface**
   ```go
   type MCPService interface {
       Name() string
       Category() string
       Capabilities() []string
       Invoke(ctx context.Context, operation string, params map[string]interface{}) (interface{}, error)
       Health(ctx context.Context) error
   }
   ```

2. **Authentication Support**
   - API Key
   - OAuth2
   - JWT
   - Custom auth

3. **Error Handling**
   - Retry logic
   - Circuit breaker
   - Timeout management
   - Rate limiting

4. **Observability**
   - Metrics collection
   - Distributed tracing
   - Structured logging

5. **Testing**
   - Unit tests (>80% coverage)
   - Integration tests
   - Mock implementations
   - Performance benchmarks
